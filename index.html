              My name is Assel, from Kazakhstan. I have been worknig as a Chief
              accountant in the railways company, and I have made successful
              career in this field. After 11 years of career, I have realized
              that it is time to change my professional area, even life.
              Therefore, I bought few courses related to Webdeveloper, exactly
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am tremendously excited at the thought
              of finding some internship programms and immediately start my way
              to Frontend Developer and be successful.
